This project encapusaltes our desire to build, create and learn. 

Fundamentally, what we are aiming here is to develop a web app that offers researchers a social network and gamified UX where they could collect and analyse data from differents users. 

In summary, we try to offer a platform where users can anonymously provide personal data regarding valuable indicators so they can compare themselves with any other group of users.

## How this is ment to work?
We provide a series of theoretical constructs in order to think our UX research proposal:

Research, and any other use case is built upon this notions:

<li>Inputs / Values</li>
This is the brick in wich the system is founded. Is refers to any kind of data voluntarily provided by users (age, incomes, expenses, etc.)

<li>Indicators</li>
Some of these data can be integrated in a new piece of information that we call "Indicator", a value that comes from combining 2 or more data points and as such has a more deep level of signification. Basic example: "saving" indicator comes from combining data from income and expenses. 

<li>Contexts</li>
This is one of the most peculiar construct. It refers to any scope of users reached under the intersection of one or more values or indicators. As such, users can compare them selves or experiment with differents contexts. 

So, a context example could be "Overeducated rich people of Buenos Aires", whose scope reaches to ever user that previously indicated some academic level, high income, and are located in Buenos Ares city.  

## Type of users
<li>Common User</li>
For them, the platform provides a social network experience that invites them to share personal data so they can compare with other users and contexts.

<li>Researchers</li>
Users that choose to create and propose their own values, indicators and contexts to be shared and interact with other users.

<li>Advertisers</li>
Not developed yet, but the idea is to compensate users for their own contribution. May be through some kind of blockchain tokenization.
